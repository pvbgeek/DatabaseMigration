# Database Migration Automation: SQL Server to PostgreSQL

This repository contains a robust **Database Migration Automation** system built using C# and .NET. The project is designed to migrate over 1 million records from SQL Server to PostgreSQL with unparalleled efficiency, leveraging Docker containers, multi-threading, and automation tools like Hangfire. 

---

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-threaded Automation
- Simultaneous fetching and pushing of records.
- Completes migration of over 1 million records within a minute.
- Ensures high efficiency and rapid execution.

### 2. Zero Downtime During Migration
- The migration process is designed to handle record requests simultaneously.
- Ensures uninterrupted access to records even during migration.

### 3. Hangfire Dashboard Integration
- Real-time monitoring of the migration pipeline.
- Provides detailed insights into task statuses and logs.

### 4. Backup and Rollback Automation with AWS EC2
- Automatic periodic backups using a multi-threaded approach.
- Triggers backups after every significant database update.
- Facilitates rollback to previous versions for enhanced reliability.

### 5. Advanced PostgreSQL Features
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Extensibility with custom types and plugins.
- Superior performance for complex queries and large datasets.

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Dockerized Environments**
   - **SQL Server**: Containerized instance hosting the source database.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Containerized instance as the target database.

2. **Migration Pipeline**
   - Written in C# and .NET.
   - Implements automation for data migration.

3. **Monitoring**
   - Hangfire dashboard for tracking migration and backup processes.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Setup Docker Containers
1. Pull the required Docker images for SQL Server and PostgreSQL.
2. Configure the containers with sample databases.

### Step 2: Configure the Migration Pipeline
- Update the connection strings for SQL Server and PostgreSQL in the pipeline.
- Specify additional settings such as backup intervals and rollback policies.

### Step 3: Execute the Migration
- Launch the migration via Hangfire.
- Monitor progress through the dashboard.
